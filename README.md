dotfiles
========

Various dotfiles and misc configs. Some of it is customized around my system setup
(like aliases pointing to paths) but you should be able to easily remove that stuff.

Installing
==========

There is an `install.sh` script that facilitates the setup, however it's been a while since I did a full system setup and this script may not be fully complete. An alternative method is to manually symlink files in the root directory. OS specific configs are in their respective folders.
